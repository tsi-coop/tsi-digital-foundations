## TSI Digital Foundations

Digital technologies have profoundly changed the ways we do business, buy, work, and live. They have even altered society and continue to impact virtually all business functions and industries. India started as an outsourcing destination in the 1990s and quickly received global prominence for the back office work. Though the outsourcing market is not growing very fast these days, with the proliferation of mobile phones and the costs of smartphones & internet coming down steeply, India itself is at the cusp of becoming a very large market for Digital Technologies with its 500 million user base.

The "TSI Digital Foundations Program" offers a pathway to digital confidence for MSME owners and aspiring professionals in India. Delivered conveniently as a webinar, it's designed for those looking to enhance their digital understanding without overwhelming complexity. We recognise the unique journey of MSMEs in today's digital world, and this program aims to be a supportive guide.

This webinar provides a thoughtful overview of today's digital essentials. We'll explore foundational elements like how networks operate, the quiet mechanics behind web and mobile apps, and key programming concepts. The program also touches upon practical areas crucial for modern business, including ensuring quality, streamlining operations, and understanding cloud services. Digital marketing strategies, data management, and information security are also woven. Importantly, we introduce various digital roles, offering a clearer picture of potential talent within your own team.

A distinctive part of this webinar is the inclusion of both digital maturity assessment for businesses and capability maturity assessment for service providers. This means you'll gain a quiet understanding of your own digital standing and learn how to evaluate the digital strengths of potential partners. It's about empowering you, the MSME owner, with insights and foundational knowledge to guide your business's digital journey.
