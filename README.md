## TSI Digital Foundations

Digital technologies have profoundly changed the ways we do business, buy, work, and live, impacting virtually all industries. India, once primarily an outsourcing hub, is now rapidly becoming a vast market for Digital Technologies, driven by widespread mobile and internet access. This shift presents both immense opportunities and new challenges for businesses.

The "TSI Digital Foundations Webinar" offers a gentle pathway to digital confidence for MSME owners and aspiring professionals in India. It's designed for those looking to subtly enhance their digital understanding without overwhelming complexity. Crucially, it also serves as a platform for service providers to quietly tune into the evolving business needs of MSMEs, allowing them to thoughtfully align their offerings. Recognising the unique journey of MSMEs in today's digital world, this program aims to be a supportive guide.

We are planning to commence our TSI Digital Foundations webinar series soon, which will encompass both learning-focused sessions to equip you with essential digital knowledge and interactive support sessions designed to address real-world challenges faced by both buyers and providers in the digital space. This webinar series will provide a thoughtful overview of today's digital essentials, exploring foundational elements like how networks operate, the quiet mechanics behind web and mobile apps, and key technical concepts. The program also touches upon practical areas crucial for modern business, including ensuring quality, streamlining operations, understanding cloud services, digital marketing strategies, data management, and information security. Importantly, we introduce various digital roles, offering a clearer picture of potential talent within your own team.
